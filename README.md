# 🌍 Bridging the Digital Divide: A Global Dashboard on Tech & Education Inequality

This project visualizes inequalities in **education access**, **literacy**, and **technology infrastructure** across regions, genders, and age groups. Built using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**, it highlights how data can inform policies for a more equitable digital future.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- Interactive filters: region, gender, age group
- KPI cards: literacy rate, internet access, education completion
- Clean UI with actionable insights
- Tableau story mode with data-backed recommendations

## 📌 Tech Stack
- `Python` for data wrangling (Pandas)
- `UN SDG datasets` for global education & tech indicators
- `Tableau` for visualization
- Version controlled via `GitHub` + built locally in `VS Code`

## 📢 Why It Matters
As part of my journey with **Google Women Techmakers**, I built this project to empower changemakers with data. The dashboard helps NGOs, educators, and public policy teams quickly spot where digital gaps exist — and act.

## 🧠 Inspiration
This work aligns with:
- **SDG 4**: Quality Education
- **SDG 5**: Gender Equality
- **SDG 9**: Industry, Innovation, Infrastructure
